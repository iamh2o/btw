Call to gather and participate
We want you to join us for a one of a kind excursion. By The Way is an experimental, off-grid gathering held on land and sea in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. 

We will be camping on private land on the waterfront of Bradford Island, and creating art and music dockside and aboard Forbes Island, the legendary floating lighthouse vessel and former restaurant.

This is a DIY event and you are invited to participate in whichever way turns you on. Check channels in this server for more information about bringing music, art, performances of all kinds, and service offerings.

Off-grid camping
We'll be camping on private land at Willow Grove Ranch on Bradford Island. Plan for off-grid style camping.

Water and Power
The event will be primarily powered by solar power, with generators as backups as needed. 

[power for campers ?]

There is no water system on the island. We will have potable water for cleaning and basic use. Forbes Island has water, but bring a few gallons for yourself. 

Food
You should plan to bring your own food.

Kitchen
We're building an outdoor communal kitchen with cooktops and food prep space for you to use. You will be responsible for bringing your own utensils, plates, cups and cooking gear. We won't be able to supply pots or pans for you. 

Sanitation
We'll have porta potties on site. 

The kitchen will have a clean up station. 

There will be an outdoor shower.  Forbes Island has a bathroom with shower on board.

Accessibility info
Arriving on Bradford Island involves boarding a ferry.

Camping is in an open field on uneven terrain and, as Braford Island is below sea level, the field is separated from the dock area by a raised retaining berm. 

Access to Forbes Island is by floating dock and gangway. Above-board areas have uneven paving and terrain, and below-decks is accessed by steep stairs. Like other boats, Forbes Island's below-decks has narrow doorways and tight corners.

Please contact us if you have mobility challenges so we can give you more detail.

Island access: IMPORTANT
Bradford Island really is an island, and is not connected to the mainland by tunnel or bridge. The only way to get to the island is by boat or by air. 

Please understand you will not be able to drive up to the campsite. You will need to arrive by pedestrian ferry and will transfer your camping gear from your car to boat on the mainland when you board. Be sure to plan for this when you pack.

The ferry will drop you off right at the Forbes Island dock and you'll be able to cart your gear the short distance to the camping area.

We will have lots more information about this as the date approaches. 
Rules
Venue rules
There are not many. They are trusting us to be considerate and respectful humans. 
Emergencies: EMS, Police, Fire
There are no police or first responders on the island.

The venue has a boat which can shuttle back to Bethel Island Marina in an emergency. Staff are available to help with this 24/7. 

In addition, the CA marine patrol will bring emergency services to the island if necessary, and medivac helicopters have options to land close to the venue if need be.

Please think of the location as quite remote.
